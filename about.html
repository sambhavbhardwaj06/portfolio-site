  <h2>Who I Am</h2>

  <p class="about-summary">
    I am an AI Engineering student focused on building polished digital experiences and practical machine learning systems.
    My work spans frontend interfaces, applied ML projects, and collaborative engineering environments that push technical
    depth and design quality. I combine problem-solving, clean implementation, and product thinking to build meaningful,
    intentional software.
